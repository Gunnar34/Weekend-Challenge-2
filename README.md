In this project I've created a project that calculates basic mathematics through use of a server.
Currently the application takes in two variables through input boxes that can be accessed with typing
or button clicks, it then packages the numbers into objects, depending on which mathematic operation button
was clicked, it then assigns a type value, so the server knows which operation to preform. these
numbers are packaged as objects and sent to the server where it unpacks them and checks what type they
are so it knows which operation to preform. It then preforms the operation and sends the final result back
as an object. The client then takes this information, appends Calculating to the display, sets a timer for
2.5 seconds and then fades the div containing Calculation out, empties it, places the result, and fades
the div back in.
